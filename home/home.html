        <h4>Intro</h4>
    
        <p>I'm a computer scientist, indie game dev, and I.T. enthusiast. While my specialty is computer graphics and physics programming (fluid simulation in particular), I also have strong interests in cybersecurity, hardware engineering, and embedded systems!</p> 
    
        <p>I obtained my B.S. in Computer Science: Animation Emphasis from Brigham Young University, with minors in Creative Writing and Mathematics. As part of my Creative Writing minor, I applied and was accepted into Brandon Sanderson's limited-enrollment course, Writing Science Fiction and Fantasy. I then obtained my M.S. in Computer Science, focusing on computational bubble simulation.</p>
    
        <p>I also enjoy coding video games, mobile apps, and websites!</p>
    
        <h4>The Rest</h4>
    
        <p>When I'm not programming, I write novels (fantasy, science fiction, and horror), make 2D and 3D digital art, run, lift weights, watch lots of animation, and play clarinet and piano. I love roller coasters, carnival rides, and water slides, and summer is my favorite season. So far, I've ridden 136 roller coasters and 89 water slides across the United States!</p>
    
        <p>My side interests include dinosaurs, geysers, psychology, Legos, lucid dreaming and OBEs, and astronomy.</p>
    
        <p>In the future, I plan to study electrical and mechanical engineering, and am also considering a computer science Ph.D. after that.</p>
