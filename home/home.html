        <h4>Intro</h4>
    
        <p>I'm a computer scientist, indie game dev, and I.T. enthusiast. </p>

        <p>My primary speciality is in computer graphics and physics programming, especially physics simulation!</p>

        <p>My other specialities are cybersecurity, hardware engineering, and embedded systems.</p>

        <p>I also create 2D and 3D digital art, write speculative fiction novels (fantasy, science fiction, and horror), run, lift weights, watch lots of animation, play video games, and play clarinet and piano.</p>
                
        <p>I obtained my B.S. in Computer Science: Animation Emphasis from Brigham Young University in 2019, with minors in Creative Writing and Mathematics. As part of my Creative Writing minor, I applied and was accepted into Brandon Sanderson's limited-enrollment course, Writing Science Fiction and Fantasy. I then completed my M.S. in Computer Science in 2024, focusing on computational bubble simulation.</p>
    
        <p>I also enjoy coding video games, mobile apps for both iOS and Android, and websites!</p>
    
        <h4>The Rest</h4>
    
        <p>I love roller coasters, carnival rides, and water slides, and summer is my favorite season. So far, I've ridden 136 roller coasters and 89 water slides across the United States!</p>
    
        <p>My side interests include dinosaurs, geysers, psychology, Legos, lucid dreaming and OBEs, and astronomy.</p>
    
        <p>In the future, I plan to study electrical and mechanical engineering, and am also considering a computer science Ph.D. after that. I'm currently studying electrical and mechanical engineering on my own for fun!</p>
