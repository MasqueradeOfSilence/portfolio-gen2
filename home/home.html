        <h4>Intro</h4>

        <p>Hello, and welcome to my site!</p>
    
        <p>I'm a computer scientist focused on computer graphics and physics programming. I'm also an indie game/app dev, digital artist, novelist, cybersecurity and I.T. enthusiast, and embedded engineer. </p>

        <p>I love to run (mostly 5Ks, 10Ks, half marathons, and marathons), lift weights, watch lots of animation, play video games, visit theme parks, and practice clarinet, voice, and piano.</p>
                
        <p>I obtained my B.S. in Computer Science: Animation and Games Emphasis from Brigham Young University in 2019, with minors in Creative Writing and Mathematics. 
            As part of my Creative Writing minor, I applied and was accepted into Brandon Sanderson's limited-enrollment course, Writing Science Fiction and Fantasy. I then completed my M.S. in Computer Science in 2024, focusing on computational foam and bubble simulation.</p>
        
        <h4>The Rest</h4>
    
        <p>I love roller coasters, carnival rides, and water slides, and summer is my favorite season. So far, I've ridden 136 roller coasters and 89 water slides across the United States! My favorite roller coasters are 
            <a href="https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/us/things-to-do/rides-attractions/jurassic-world-velocicoaster">Velocicoaster</a> and <a href="https://www.cedarpoint.com/rides-experiences/steel-vengeance">Steel Vengeance</a>, and my favorite waterslide is <a href="https://cherry-hill.com/attractions/double-dragons/">Double Dragons.</a></p>
    
        <p>My side interests include dinosaurs, geysers, psychology, Legos, lucid dreaming, and astronomy.</p>
    
        <p>Additionally, I'm currently studying electrical and mechanical engineering on my own for fun! I'm hoping to combine them with computer science to learn more about robotics and theme park design.</p>

        <p>Above all, I value strong work-life balance, daily atomic habits, imagination, intellect, love and compassion, and striving to be in the top caliber of everything I do.</p>

        <p>"Showing up every single day -- deciding and then doing -- it's not hard work. It's just my standard." - Nick Bare</p>
